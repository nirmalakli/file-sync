1) Sync-configuration file:
File-Sync application should be able to read sync-configuration meta-data file. Sync config file contains entries of mappings of source patterns vs destination patterns.
These patterns are hierarchical patterns. 

e.g.
/home/nirmal/Documents -> /media/hdd-ntfs/nirmal/pc/Documents
/home/nirmal/Documents/Personal/Wife -> /media/hdd-ntfs/pooja/pc/Documents
/home/nirmal/Videos/Movies -> /media/hdd-ntfs/nirmal/Videos/Movies

Tasks:
a) A Metadata class to represent this configuration.
b) A class which accepts a source path and returns a mapping for it.
